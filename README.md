# Fetch-Data-Analytics-Home-Test

#### Explanation:
     
    * I have used PostgreSQL database and SQL language for the exercise.
    * I cretaed the database - SHREY_FETCH_DATA_ANALYTICS and created the definitions for 
      4 tables - users, brands, receipts, and receipt_items in public schema.
    * I have created the tables with primary keys and constraints of foreign keys
      with check clauses.
    * Once the tables are created, I have used the SQL Shell (psql) to load the cleaned
      CSV files into those table definitoions.
    * Once data was loaded, I ran the queries to get the desired results.
